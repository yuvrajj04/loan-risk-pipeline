# Loan Risk Analytics Pipeline

## Overview

The **Loan Risk Analytics Pipeline** is a mini data engineering project that processes loan datasets to evaluate borrower risk.
The pipeline ingests raw CSV data, performs validation checks, applies financial transformations (EMI and Debt-to-Income ratio), stores processed data in a database, and generates analytics reports.

This project simulates a **real-world financial data processing workflow** used in lending and credit risk systems.

## Problem Statement

Financial institutions must evaluate borrower risk before approving loans. Raw loan data must be cleaned, validated, and transformed into meaningful financial metrics to determine borrower risk levels.

This project demonstrates how a **data pipeline** can automate that process by:

- Ingesting raw loan datasets
- Validating data quality
- Computing financial metrics
- Classifying loan risk
- Persisting processed data
- Generating analytics reports

## Data Flow

1. **Data Ingestion**
   - Reads loan dataset from CSV using Pandas.

2. **Data Validation**
   - Detects null values
   - Detects negative loan amounts
   - Validates interest rates
   - Checks duplicate loan IDs

3. **Data Transformation**
   - Calculates EMI (Equated Monthly Installment)
   - Calculates monthly income
   - Computes Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI)
   - Classifies borrower risk (Low / Medium / High)

4. **Data Storage**
   - Stores transformed dataset in a SQLite database.

5. **Analytics**
   - Calculates summary metrics
   - Generates risk distribution report
   - Exports analytics CSV files.
